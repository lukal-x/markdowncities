## Design variety

This page is an example of markdowncities' support for design/template variance; it uses a template that's similar to the one in the [home page](index.html) but different, in this one all lists are formatted as a touchscreen-friendly grid:

- See the [file naming conventions](https://github.com/lukal-x/markdowncities/tree/master/sources) in the source code
- This block is blue
- This block is blue as well
- This block is brown though, see [how to use inline CSS **in markdown!**](https://github.com/lukal-x/markdowncities/tree/master/sources/about.md)
{: style="background: linear-gradient(to right, brown, darkred);" }
